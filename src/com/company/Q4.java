// Question : A Company manufactures Vehicles, which could be a Helicopter
// , a Car, or a Train depending on the customerâ€™s demand. Each Vehicle
// instance has a method called move, which prints on the console the
// nature of movement of the vehicle. For example, the Helicopter Flies in
// Air, the Car Drives on Road and the Train Runs on Track.
// Write a program that accepts input from the user on the kind of vehicle
// the user wants to order, and the system should print out nature of
// movement. Implement all Java coding best practices to implement this
// program.
